Creating Your Own List

Read the Awesome manifesto and list guidelines and ensure your list complies.
Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
You might find this Yeoman generator useful.
Wait at least 30 days after creating a list before submitting it, to give it a chance to mature.
Make sure you read the list guidelines again before submitting a pull request for your list to be added here.

Thanks for being awesome! 😎
